# PowerBI-Projects

This repository contains Power BI projects created for practice and portfolio purposes using sample/fake data. The projects reflect my growing interest in data analytics and business intelligence, and my commitment to learning and improving my skills. Starting from tutorials, I consistently add personal insights and improvements to make each dashboard more meaningful and valuable. These projects showcase my curiosity, hands-on learning, and enthusiasm for building a career in the data analytics field.
